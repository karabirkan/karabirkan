```swift
public struct AboutMe {
    let name = "Birkan"
    var pronouns = ["he","him"]
    
    let profession = "Frontend Developer @ Garcia"
    
    var preferredTechStack = ["Javascript", "ReactJs", "NextJS", "Typescript"]
    var hasUsed = ["react", "javascript", "next"]
}
```

I solve problems using the tools available to me. I generally like using React and NextJS but not afraid to try something new.
